# call-by-value-and-reference-using-pointers
using the above c programs, swaping of integers is done using pointers and both the function calling types are used call by value and call by reference 
# Call By Value: 
In this parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to functionâ€™s formal parameters and the two types of parameters are stored in different memory locations. So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in actual parameters of caller.

# Call by Reference:
Both the actual and formal parameters refer to same locations, so any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in actual parameters of caller.
